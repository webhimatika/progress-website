          <p>Hello Mathematicians!</p>
          <p>
            It’s hard to believe that the 2024 HIMATIKA administration has been 
            running for four months already. How do you feel, friends? Have you 
            settled in over these four months? You should have by now. On Saturday 
            and Sunday, May 25-26, HIMATIKA 2024 held one of the mandatory activities 
            for the board members, namely Upgrading 2024, which took place at Rumah 
            Revolusi Mental WCS. This activity aimed to build a sense of belonging 
            among the board members towards HIMATIKA FMIPA UNS. The theme of this 
            event was "Stepping Up Our Family and Progressivity Together for a Better 
            HIMATIKA."
          </p>
          <p>
            The event began with a presentation by Mas Afif Zakiy Abdullah, a former 
            HIMATIKA board member. After the introductory presentation, the event 
            continued with a Q&A session, where the board members were very enthusiastic 
            in asking questions. The final session was an interactive discussion to solve 
            a problem. In this session, the board members were divided into small forums, 
            each with a specific topic to be presented in the main forum later. This 
            interactive discussion was very conducive, structured, and of course, 
            interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next event in the evening was group performances, opened by the event 
            committee, followed by each group representative drawing lots for the 
            performance order. There were two types of performances determined by the event 
            committee: a flash mob and a drama. The following morning's activities included 
            a morning exercise led by fitness instructors Mas Agrip and Mas Ihsan. After 
            the exercise, there was an outbound activity guided by the DPO and former board 
            members, consisting of three stations: Water Relay (Estafet Air), Water Tray 
            Relay (Estafet Nampan Air), and Pingpong Ball Blow (Tiup Bola Pingpong). The 
            groups were then re-divided to find the HIMATIKA puzzle pieces hidden by the DPO. 
            The final event was the awarding of prizes to the winners.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the excitement of this year’s upgrading event. Hopefully, with this 
            upgrading, all the HIMATIKA 2024 board members can feel the sense of family.
